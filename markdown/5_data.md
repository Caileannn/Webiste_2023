(ðŸ”—)[http://conceptnull.org/data] In 2023, Concept Null had the pleasure to chat with Paul, Tom, and Aisling, who lead the Dublin Art & Technology Association (D.A.T.A). Since 2022, D.A.T.A has been a hub for artists, makers, and thinkers to exchange ideas on digital culture in Ireland. During the conversation, D.A.T.A explored it's identity, evolution, and the intricacies of event curation and organisation.

The website presents the interview in both linear and non-linear formats. By utilising machine learning and natural language processing, text segments extracted from the interview were ranked against key topics; creating a higher-dimensional understanding, and projection of the interview - which is commonly referred to as the latent space. After, a t-SNE algorithm was applied to high-dimensional space, flattening it into two dimensions, represented in the interactive map; allowing the user to navigate the interview from the persepctive of the machine.
