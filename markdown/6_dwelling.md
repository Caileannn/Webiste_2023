# text
Dwelling is a dynamic live performance and theatre installation created by (Peter Power)[https://peterpower.ie/] and (Leon Butler)[https://bold.ie/]. The performance explores the periphery of cultural isolation, and the dispersal of self across the multimedial, delving into themes of digital mortality, transformation, and rebirth. The performance takes place in the fragments of a home with dance performances by Robyn Byrne and Rosie Stebbing. The characters moves between the digital and real space through motion capture data in conjunction with live tracking. Over the duration of the performance, Rosise starts to form a connection between her physical self, and the digital divide.

The virtual world was created entirely within Unity. Data was captured from Robyn's movement through various methods, such as the Perception Neuron mo-cap suit, as well as emerging monocular 3d human pose detection models. Unity's particle system was used extensivley in the project, converting point cloud and positional data into emergent movement, and ethereal landscapes.
