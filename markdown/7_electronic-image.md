This video series comprises of three individual studies, namely Embedded Energy, Electronic Phase, and Omnidirectional Objects, with each video study exploring an inherent characteristic of the video signal that reflects the key phases of the development in the evolution of the medium‚Äôs structural, temporal and spatial capabilities. Created as part of my Thesis ‚ÄúThe Electronic Image: An Object of Time and Energy‚Äù in Art and Technology MA, University of Limerick, Ireland.
# text
The three studies have been shaped by the experimental processes, techniques, and philosophies of the pioneering artists working with video. The artists in question, specifically the works of Steina and Woody Vasulka, who were driven by their yearning to understand the electronic signal and to formulate an electronic lexicon. The work, in its entirety, is an investigation of the unique set of ‚Äúcodes‚Äù embedded within the language of the video signal, consequently, recognising the electronic image as an object of time, energy, and it's programmable building element ‚Äì the waveform.
